# DSA210Project
My name is Burak Anlamaz (32366) my project will focus on my letterboxd data.

-Motivation: As a filmlover I wanted to analyze my data about movies using the letterboxd app.
 
-Dataset: I will be using the dataset I acquired from the letterboxd app which contains all of the data I need to work on my project.

 Project idea: I will analyze my dataset and visualize the following:
 
 1)My viewing trends
 
 2)My rating distrubution
 
 3)My favorite genres and directors
 
 4)New movies to watch according to my movie watching patterns
   
Plan: First I will collect my data from the letterboxd app and preprocess it in order to work on it properly. Later on I will use EDA in order to anlyze my data. Finally I will visulalize the data I acquired.
